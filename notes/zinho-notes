Repressilator

The repressilator is a biological system that uses the negative feedback to inhibit the production of a protein in
a circular fashion. The original version proposed by Michael B. Elowitz and Stanislas Leibler has three genes that produces
each a different protein, the production of one of them inhibits the the expression of the next gene in the circular order.
The experiment was done in the Escherichia coli and those three genes proposed were tetR, (lambda) cl, Lacl.

[Concentration plot]

As the above plot shows, the behavior of the repressilator tends to be oscillatory and not to reach a steady state.

[Mathematical model]

The system of differentials equations tells the behavior of the concentrations of each protein and their corresponding gene
in the cell.
