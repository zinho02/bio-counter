# Bio-counter
A study and implementation with simulation tools of biological oscillators.

## Abstract: 
Implemantation of a 3-bit ascending counter in genetic circuits or in biochemical signaling pathways in a organism.

## Objectives: 
1.    Research for real biological oscillators
2.    Research on chemical reactions and control of genetic expressions that act as biological oscillators.
3.    Generically model a 1-bit oscillator and then implement modeling with real parameters.
4.    Generically model a 2-bit oscillator and then implement modeling with real parameters.
5.    Generically model a 3-bit oscillator and then implement real-parameter modeling. 

## Methodology:
1.    Search for information sources for biological oscillators, their behaviors, details of reactions that perform them.
2.    Filter sources to certain constraints that are oriented toward the objectives defined above.
3.    In-depth study of restricted sources.
4.    Implementation of oscillators studied above in simulation tools.
5.    Draft documentation of the process and results.
6.    Gradually advance with more advanced oscillators of more bits and repeat steps 3-5.
7.    Structuring of the scientific article model based on what was studied and the implementation results.
8.    Scientific article writing.
